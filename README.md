# Sahasi_Flutter_SQLite
 A cross-platform women’s safety mobile  application using Flutter.

Enabling simultaneous deployment on both Android and iOS. Unlike 
many existing safety apps that depend heavily on internet connectivity and cloud services, this 
application will store all user data and evidence locally on the device using SQLite, ensuring 
greater privacy and offline functionality. 

**The application will include: **
• Emergency SOS activation via on-screen button or hardware shortcut. 
• Real-time GPS location sharing via SMS for offline operation. 
• Automatic audio/video evidence recording, saved locally. 
• Fake call simulation to discreetly exit dangerous situations. 
• One-tap police/emergency services contact with Nepal’s emergency numbers pre-configured.
